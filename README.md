The Grotte des Pigeons, also known as Tafoughalt due to its proximity to the namesake village, is a cave located in the Berkane province of Morocco’s Oriental Region. Decades of excavations have revealed the world’s oldest known skull showing successful evidence of the medical procedure known as trepanation as well as revealing burial customs of the Iberomaurusian people dating from about 20,000 to10,000 years ago. Although the cave and its surrounding area are rich in scientific and cultural significance, tourism to the region remains low because of its remote location and the lack of publicity about the cave. Working with our sponsor, Association Passagers, we made 3D models of artifacts and 360-degree images of the cave to be integrated into an interactive digital platform that will highlight the area’s key attractions and encourage tourism to the region, ultimately boosting the local economy.
